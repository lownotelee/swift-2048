swift-2048
==========
My fork of Austin's Swift-2048 project with changes, improvements, updates, lots of other things.

I have been pretty obsessed with 2048 for a while now, and I was looking for a project to poke around in to see how Swift works There's no better place to learn than in an open source game I'm already familiar with.

This project has been amazing for me. I've learned so much by doing this, and looking back on it now, some things I really struggled to understand are now concepts I can grasp easily.

It's currently built for iOS 9 and above. I'm very keen on making it compatible with dark mode, so I'll need to figure out how to get it to check for iOS 13 and above.

Original readme.md from Austin;
------------

A working port of [iOS-2048](https://github.com/austinzheng/iOS-2048) to Apple's new Swift language.

Like the original Objective-C version, swift-2048 does not rely upon SpriteKit. See the description for iOS-2048 for more information.

I'm not actively working on this, except to fix bugs and maintain compatibility with latest versions. Pull requests are welcome, though. Note that Swift was very different back when I first wrote this code, caveat emptor.


If you want to check out a more advanced Swift project, please take a look at **[Lambdatron](https://github.com/austinzheng/Lambdatron)**, my Clojure interpreter.

Instructions
------------

You will need Xcode 7 to run the project. Run it in the simulator or on an actual device.

Tap the button to play the game. Swipe to move the tiles.

Thoughts on Swift
-----------------

Swift is a well-designed language that will, hopefully, drag mainstream programming halfway to ML (kicking and screaming the entire way, of course).

If you really want to see my out-of-date thoughts on Swift, check out the git history for `README.md`.
